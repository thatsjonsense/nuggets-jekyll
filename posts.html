    - text: "&ldquo;Game&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t even do it justice. What we&rsquo;re really talking about here is a generative, networked system laced throughout with secrets."
      quote: true
    - text: "As you explore the extended Minecraft-verse online, you start to get the same oceanic feeling that huge internet systems like YouTube and Twitter often inspire: the mingling of despair (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never see it all&rdquo;) with delight (&ldquo;People made this&rdquo;) with dizzying anthropic awe (&ldquo;So&hellip; many&hellip; people.&rdquo;)"
      quote: true
    - text: "We&rsquo;re in a new century now, and its hallmark is humans doing things together, mostly on screens, at scales unimaginable in earlier times."
      quote: true
    - text: "But I think Markus Persson and his studio have staked out a new kind of achievement, a deeper kind: To make the system that calls forth the book, which is not just a story but a real magick manual that grants its reader (who consumes it avidly, endlessly, all day, at school, at night, under the covers, studying, studying) new and exciting powers in a vivid, malleable world."

    - text: "The new issue of the Atlantic has a great [interview with Michael Jones](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/01/the-places-youll-go/309191/), Google&rsquo;s &quot;Chief Technology Advocate&quot; (apparently it needed one). Jones was a co-founder of Keyhole, the company that built the mapping technology that now powers Google Earth. Now I guess he just spends his time saying smart stuff in magazines."
    - text: "James Fallows: The entire concept of a &ldquo;map&rdquo; seems radically different from even a decade ago. It used to be something in a book or on a wall; now it&rsquo;s something you carry around on your smartphone. Which changes have mattered most? And what further changes should we be ready for?"
      quote: true
    - text: "Michael Jones: The major change in mapping in the past decade, as opposed to in the previous 6,000 to 10,000 years, is that mapping has become personal."
      quote: true
    - text: "It&rsquo;s not the map itself that has changed. You would recognize a 1940 map and the latest, modern Google map as having almost the same look. But the old map was a fixed piece of paper, the same for everybody who looked at it. The new map is different for everyone who uses it. You can drag it where you want to go, you can zoom in as you wish, you can switch modes&mdash;traffic, satellite&mdash;you can fly across your town, even ask questions about restaurants and directions. So a map has gone from a static, stylized portrait of the Earth to a dynamic, interactive conversation about your use of the Earth."
      quote: true
    - text: "That&rsquo;s my emphasis added. I love the idea of a map as a &ldquo;conversation.&rdquo; Old maps were static records, sitting there inert on slices of dead tree. New maps are like Yelp reviews: a layer of dialogue superimposed right on the planet, finding you the best falafel on any street corner in the world. We&rsquo;re all reading the maps and writing them, panning and zooming and reviewing and navigating a big collaborative atlas."
